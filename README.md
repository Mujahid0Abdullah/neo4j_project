A project will be carried out to understand and visualize the relationships between events and the roles of the SAHABI (Companions of the Prophet) in order to graphically illustrate the history of the birth of Islam.

Summary of the Project:
It aims to visualize the lives and relationships of Sahabi'es(Companions of the Prophet) in Islamic history using Neo4j. They will be modeled as a graph in Neo4j, using a data set containing the companions' family connections, dates of acceptance of Islam, dates of death, wars they participated in, and other important information.
In addition to Neo4j, GraphXR will be utilized to map these relationships onto a geographical map, providing an even richer understanding of the spread of Sahabi'es(Companions of the Prophet)  across different regions.

The project aims to present a new approach to the study of Islamic history. It is to visualize historical events and the relationships between the Companions in order to understand the birth and development of Islam.

Its scope includes working on a dataset that includes the main events of Islam and its Companions.

-Historical events and political developments in the early years of Islam will be better understood.

-The role of the Companions in conquests and other important events will be more clearly revealed.

-The spread of Islam and its impact on different geographies will be better analyzed.
